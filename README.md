# HaloRecordedAnimationTools
Being worked on as my motivation holds - not entirely sure if this will be possible how I want. Even so, it's still a good learning experience.

The 'master' branch should be able to open a scenario and list the animations. It can also hook into a Halo CE process and read player movement and stances from it. 'dev' branch is currently getting a UI overhaul and doesn't work.
